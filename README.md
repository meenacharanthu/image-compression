# Image Compression


1. In this this exercise, you will implement the K-means algorithm and use it for image compression. You will first start on an example 2D dataset that will help you gain an intuition of how the K-means algorithm works. After
that, you wil use the K-means algorithm for image compression by reducing the number of colors that occur in an image to only those that are most common in that image.
